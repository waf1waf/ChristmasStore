Thank you for volunteering to serve others at The Christmas Store!

{reservationManager}

Please check in at NHF West, 816 E. Williams Street in Apex, right next to New Horizons Fellowship.  There you will receive your volunteer badge and be directed to your Area Leader, who will show you where you will be serving and what you will be doing.

NHF West will serve as "volunteer central," where you can find restrooms and light refreshments.  Feel free to bring a snack (sweet or savory) to share with the other volunteers.

Get your Christmas Store Volunteer T-shirt while they last!  Proceeds from T-shirt sales go to purchase TOYS, TOYS, and MORE TOYS!  Shirts are $10 each and will be available at Volunteer Check-in.  Adult Sizes: Small-3XL (Talls also available).

If you will not be able to work your shift, please contact New Horizons Fellowship at (919) 303-5266 or reply to this email as soon as possible.
